# EntomoloGUI
GUI for interfacting with the Pi-Eyes


For this to work:
Top canon camera needs to have owner named "Top" in the camera itself
Side canon camera needs to have owner named "Side" in the camera itself
both canon cameras need to never auto turn off (can be set in the settings)
both canon cameras need to have an sd card in them for storage
